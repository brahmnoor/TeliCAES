              <li><strong>1.</strong> The <strong>present perfect tense</strong> is quite often used as a "bridging" device to make connection between previous
                 research and your research.  In many cases, the present perfect is used to "foreshadow" your research. You
                 indicate what <strong>has been found</strong> in the field, point out a research gap, and then explain how your research will
                 "fill in the gap".
                <p>e.g. <i>Recent research <strong>has suggested</strong> that academic prose is not completely impersonal, but that writers gain credibility by
                  projecting an identity invested with individual authority, displaying confidence in their evaluations and commitment to their
                  ideas (Hyland, 2002).</i></p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>2.</strong> When reporting previous research, many researchers will also choose to put them in passive voice, so that the "doer" of the action
                (the research) can be hidden.  This can make the sentence more concise, especially when it is not essential to mention the authors or the
                researchers of the studies you are talking about at the beginning of the sentence:
                <p>e.g. <i>A great deal of <strong>research has been conducted</strong> on the relative cold-hardiness of species of different geographical distribution
                   and origins under various temperature regimes (Solomon & Shugart, 2012).</i></p>
                <p>e.g. <i>It <strong>has been widely observed</strong> that inappropriate use of antibiotics can lead to resistance.  </i></p>
              </li>
