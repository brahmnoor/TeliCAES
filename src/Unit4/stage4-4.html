              <strong>Past Simple Tense is generally used for the following purposes:</strong>
              <li><strong>1.</strong> To bring other studies into your text, especially those which are relatively dated:
                <p>e.g. <i>Penicillin was considered the drug of choice in the treatment of anaerobic
                  infections (Tally, Stutter & Finegold, 1975).</i></p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>2.</strong> In many cases, the simple past is used to as a "distancing" device to report
                findings/results/opinions that an author deems false or does not agree with:
                <p>e.g. <i>“As long as the researcher used language skillfully and avoided personal
                  bias, then the reader could simply decode the transmitted message to recover the same
                  reality. In contrast to this Shannon and Weaver' s (1963) view of communication, a great
                   deal of research has recently shown how professional writers seek to achieve successful
                   interaction with their readers while maintaining the integrity of their data” (Hyland,
                   2001, pp.207-208).</i>
                 </p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>3.</strong> To describe what you did in your study. In the results section, the past tense is
                commonly used to report your findings. However, you may need to check first if this is
                the case in your field.  Notice the use of passive voice in the examples below.
                <p>e.g. <i>The interviews <strong>were conducted</strong> with experienced researchers from the target
                  disciplines using a structured format (Hyland, 2001). (Humanities)</i></p>
                <p>e.g. <i>An established protocol <strong>was observed</strong> for the briefing of the participants. (Science)</i></p>
                <p>e.g. <i>Results <strong>indicated</strong> that extended exposure to sunlight had a strong correlation with the one's
                  possibility of developing skin cancer. (Science)</i></p>
                <p>e.g. <i>The control group of students <strong>took</strong> the course previously. (Education)</i></p>
              </li>
