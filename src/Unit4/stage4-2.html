              <p><strong>The present simple tense is commonly used in academic Writing. </strong></p>

              <strong>It is used:</strong>
              <li><strong>1.</strong> In the introductory part of your writing, to "contextualize" your paper: you need to present general
                information about the topic you are focusing on, especially information which is widely regarded as factual
                 or true in the field. This is usually followed by an explanation of the contribution that your own study/research
                is expected to make to the field. These moves are usually presented in the <strong>simple present tense.</strong>
                <p>e.g. <i>Genome <strong>gives</strong> important information about gene pattern.</i></p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>2.</strong> To present the current state of research in the field (e.g. by interpreting, concluding, summarising previous research):
                <p>e.g. <i>Most studies in the area of academic stance <strong>appear</strong> to be mainly concerned with the use of reporting verbs.</i></p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>3.</strong> To talk about the significance of your findings/results in the discussion section of your paper:
                <p>e.g. <i>The findings <strong>suggest</strong> that doxycycline works as well as penicillin in the treatment of syphilis.</i></p>
              </li>

              <li><strong>4.</strong> Many researchers also use the simple present tense to report findings/results from other studies/research which they deem to be true, reliable or trustworthy, even though these studies were conducted in the past.  By reporting these findings in simple present tense, they are presented as  "facts":
                <p>e.g. <i>Multiple studies <strong>show</strong> that antibiotic resistance is becoming more serious in developing countries.</i></p>
              </li>
