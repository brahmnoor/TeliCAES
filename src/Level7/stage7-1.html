              <p><strong>1. </strong>It is rather simple to generate nouns in the English language. For example, -ing can be added to a verb which can then become a noun (aka gerund): “seeing is believing”, “blowing bubbles is what children usually like”, “Susie tactfully avoided driving off the beach”.</p>
              <p><strong>2. </strong>Likewise, attaching suffixes such as -ism, -ness and -ity to an adjective can transform the adjective itself into a noun: “The rapid growth of imperialism raises public awareness and increases the probability of a nuclear war”.</p>
              <p><strong>3. </strong>Sometimes, nominalization can be done by placing a definite article i.e. “the” in front of an adjective forming noun phrases like the deaf, the injured, the poor, the unemployed, etc.</p>
              <p><strong>4. </strong>On the other hand, nominalization can occur by simply converting verbs or adjectives into nouns without the need for changing the word form or adding extra lexical elements. Read the two tables below (Huddleston & Pullum, 2002, pp.1641-1642):</p>
