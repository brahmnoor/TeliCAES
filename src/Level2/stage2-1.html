        </h3>
        <p>Linking words, also known as transition words or connectors, can link writer's / speaker's ideas forwards and
          backwards to guide the reader / listener through the text. Let us compare the two paragraphs below to see how
          linking words influence the readers. Linking words have been deleted in Paragraph 1, whereas Paragraph 2
          (the original text) is the exact same content with linking words</p>

                The elitism of publicly funded degrees is even reinforced with an increase of sub-degree programs.
                Educational opportunities in publicly funded universities are only allocated to the top secondary
                students who obtain the highest examination scores. Self-financing programs are considered a second
                choice to students. Students in self-financed programs have paid a much higher tuition fee than their
                counterparts in publicly funded bachelor’s degree programs. The value placed on education by Hong Kong
                households is enough to convince less academically gifted students to pay a higher fee for a semester at
                a community college than that paid for a semester at a university. An associate degree is less valued
                than a bachelor’s degree in the job market.

              Both paragraphs contain the same information, but it is evident that Paragraph 2 is easier to follow. This
              is because the linking words guide the readers by signaling and connecting the meanings of different
              ideas.
