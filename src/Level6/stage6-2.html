            <p><strong>According to Hyland (1998), academic writers use hedges for the following purposes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>1. </strong>Protect your claim from possible attack</li>
              <li><strong>2. </strong>Demonstrate doubt</li>
              <li><strong>3. </strong>Express tentativeness</li>
              <li><strong>4. </strong>Discuss a possibility</li>
              <li><strong>5. </strong>Show that information is not a verified fact</li>
              <li><strong>6. </strong>Enable the writer to make claims that are proportionate to the evidence available at the time of writing</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Compare the examples below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>Student A: The rapid growth of higher education decreases the quality of students entering tertiary education.</i></li>
              <li><i>Student B: The rapid growth of higher education appears to decrease the quality of students entering tertiary education.</i></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>Now compare another pair of examples:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><i>The low recognition of the associate's degree was <u>probably</u> due to the perceived insufficient quality of these programs.</i></li>
              <li><i>The low recognition of the associate's degree <u>could have been</u> due to the perceived insufficient quality of these programs.</i></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The two sentences above are identical, except for the hedging languages. Is there any difference between “probably” and “could have been”? Which one shows stronger evidence?</p>
            <p>Click on this <a href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="show();">link</a> to show the explanation.</p>
            <p id="paragraph"style="border: 1px solid black; display: none; padding: 5px;">In fact, <strong>“probably”</strong> implies that the writer has some evidence to his / her claim, which has been
              argued earlier in this paragraph. However, <strong>“could have been”</strong> indicates that the writer is making an assumption based on what has
              been argued earlier in the paragraph. Comparing the <strong>meanings</strong> of these hedges in the two sentences, one can say that Sentence 1 has
              stronger evidence for this claim. In other words, writers <strong>need to match the evidence</strong> they have for that claim when selecting hedging languages.</p>
