            <p><strong>Why Should You Use “Cautious Language”?</strong></p>
            <p>Both hedging and boosting are effective tools for balancing argument and making accurate claims in academic writing and speaking.</p>
            <p>Hedging can be used as a “polite strategy” to soften your speech. On the other hand, functions of hedging are more complicated in writing. Compare the examples below:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Speaking:</strong>
                <p><strong>1. </strong><i>You should apply to all universities in Hong Kong (direct).</i></p>
                <p><strong>2. </strong><i><u>Perhaps</u> you <u>may</u> apply to all universities in Hong Kong (less direct).</i></p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Writing:</strong>
                <p><strong>1. </strong><i>The growing class size means that university students will have less face-to-face time with their teachers (assertive).</i></p>
                <p><strong>2. </strong><i>The growing class size <u>seems to imply</u> that university students will have less face-to-face time with their teachers (Shows
                  some doubts? Acknowledges opposing viewpoint? Or the writer does not have enough evidence to make an assertive claim?).</i></p>
