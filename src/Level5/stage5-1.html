                <p>As a general rule, you should only use the passive voice when you have a good reason NOT to use the active voice. Writing is usually clearer and more interesting in the active voice - this includes academic writing.</p>
                <p>However, this does not mean that the passive voice should be completely avoided. Some conditions/situations warrant the use of the passive voice.</p>

                <p><strong>The passive voice can be used in the following situations:</strong></p>
                  <p>when we do not know who the subject/doer/agent is.</p>
                  <p>when the subject/doer is very general and obvious.</p>
                  <p>when the subject/doer is not the important information in the sentence, something else is.</p>
                  <p>when we want to hide the subject from the reader, for some reason.</p>
