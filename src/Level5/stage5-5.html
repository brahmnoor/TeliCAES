                    towards the end of the twentieth century. Massification, as a process, challenges the traditional form of universities as centres of elite education where only a select few gain access. This increased enrolment represents significant changes in many countries higher education systems and appears to be occurring, at least in part, due to evidence that links higher education to improved health, empowerment and economic development. Further, such a phenomenon is a result of the democratization of education and the social justice agenda in many countries. By democratization, we refer to a process where access to higher education <strong>is viewed</strong>
                    <select id="q3">
                      <option value="Please select" disabled="disabled" selected="selected">Please select</option>

                    </select>
                    as an integral element in resolving social and economic inequalities present in societies. The effect of this <strong>is felt</strong>
                    <select id="q4">
                      <option value="Please select" disabled="disabled" selected="selected">Please select</option>

                    beyond a pure increase in student numbers with impacts in the composition, character and aspirations of student populations and thus, has the potential to profoundly transform higher education sectors and states as a whole. <strong>This is further understood</strong>

                      <option value="Please select" disabled="disabled" selected="selected">Please select</option>

                    </select>
                    when considering the argument that higher education can lead to both private and public benefits for a country. Private benefits <strong>are seen</strong>
                    <select id="q6">
                      <option value="Please select" disabled="disabled" selected="selected">Please select</option>

                    in the rise in employment prospects, incomes and ability to invest and save money.
                    <hr>
                    This leads to improving productivity since higher education is tied to overall better health and longer life expectancies. As for public benefits, higher earnings for well-educated individuals raise tax revenues for governments and ease demands on state finances. They also translate into greater consumption, which benefits producers from all educational backgrounds. Indeed, it appears that growing class sizes have been a direct effect of massification as there has been no proportionate increase in human, financial, and physical support from public sources in the higher education sector globally. This means as enrolment grows, universities <strong>are being expected</strong>
                     <select id="q7">
                       <option value="Please select" disabled="disabled" selected="selected">Please select</option>

                     </select>
                    to accommodate greater numbers of students with less resources. It is interesting to consider that greater support <strong>has not been forthcoming</strong>
                    <select id="q8">

                      <option value="B">B</option>
                    </select>
                    despite a literature on large classes that generally considers them a challenge to the quality of the learning environment.
                    <hr>
                    There is a long-standing belief that the number of students in a class affects the quality of the learning environment. In particular, large classes <strong>are believed to</strong>

                    </select>
                    correlate with low student performance. However, class size in and of itself is not a distinguishing feature of student performance; rather, class size matters in relation to education goals and the quality of education experience.
