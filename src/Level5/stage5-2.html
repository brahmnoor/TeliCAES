          <div class="item">
            <ul>
              <li>
                <h4>1. Unknown subject</h4>
                <strong>We use the passive when we do not know who the subject/agent/doer is. </strong>For example:
                <ol>
                  <li>‘The fossil <strong>was unearthed</strong> in 1913.’ – (It is not possible anymore to trace the exact person who unearthed the fossil.)</li>
                  <li>‘Opium <strong>was first used</strong> as a form of pain relieving medication.’ – (We do not know who exactly first used opium as a pain-relieving medication.)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
              <li>
                <h4>2. General or Obvious Subject</h4>
                <strong>We use the passive when the subject is very general and obvious. It is unnecessary or even redundant to mention the doer of the action. </strong>For example:
                <ol>
                  <li>‘Strict research protocols <strong>must be followed</strong> at the research centre.’ - (Obviously by staff/researchers at the research centre) <strong>VS</strong></li>
                  <li>‘Staff and researchers at the research centre <strong>must follow</strong> strict research protocols.’ – (Wordy)</li>
                  <li>‘English is the medium of instruction at HKU and all assignments <strong>must be written or presented</strong> in English.’... (Obviously by students at HKU) <strong>VS</strong></li>
                  <li>‘English is the medium of instruction at HKU and students at HKU <strong>must write or present</strong> all their assignments in English (Wordy)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
              <li>
                <h4>3. Action More Important than Subject</h4>
                <strong>We use the passive when the action is more important than the subject/doer/agent.</strong>This is common in scientific writing, where the writer wants to emphasize what was done, not who did it. For example:
                <ol>
                  <li>‘50 people <strong>were interviewed</strong> about their experience of crime in Hong Kong.’ – (It is NOT important to state that the researcher did the interviewing.)</li>
                  <li>‘Data <strong>were analysed</strong> to see if men and women had different experiences.’ – (It is NOT important to state who did the data analysis.)</li>
                  <li>‘The classroom interaction <strong>was transcribed, coded and systematically analysed’</strong> – (In the materials and methods section of a research article, passive is generally more often used.)</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
            <ul style="margin-top: 1rem;">
              <li>
                <h4>4. “De-emphasizing” the Subject</h4>
                <p><strong>We use the passive when we want to hide or “de-emphasise” the doer, for some reason. </strong>A common example of this in academic writing is when we take out the ‘I’ (the author as the subject) to make our writing sound more objective. It makes the opinions expressed in the writing less based on the writer’s own personal, possibly biased, opinion. </p>
                <p>The following active sentence, where the author gives his/her opinion, may sound subjective and can be interpreted to be biased by the reader as it is just based on one opinion.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>‘‘I think that the Hong Kong Government was incompetent in the way that it handled the housing issues.’</li>
                </ol>
                <p>To solve this problem, we can insert an <strong>impersonal (it) passive with a ‘that clause’ instead</strong>, along with a <strong>citation</strong> to strengthen the opinion.</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>‘<strong>It is believed that</strong> the Hong Kong Government was incompetent in the way that it handled the housing issues (Smith, 2012).’</li>
                </ol>
                Here, Smith could be a member of the government, a professor at a university who is an expert in housing and land development.<br><br>Other verbs that are used in this way are:
                <ol>
                <li>‘It is <strong>believed/thought</strong> that …’</li>
                <li>‘It has been <strong>said/claimed/estimated/suggested/<br>proposed/supposed</strong> that…’</li>
                </ol>
              </li>
            </ul>
