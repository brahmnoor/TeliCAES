      </div>

              <li>
                <ol>
                  <li>Whilst the active voice is generally preferred in academic writing, in some cases, it is acceptable to use the passive voice. For example:
                  <ol>
                  <li>When the subject/agent of an action is not easily identifiable</li>
                  <li>When the subject/agent of an action is obvious from the context</li>
                  <li>When the emphasis is on the information being presented, but not the subject/agent</li>
                  <li>When you wish to hide the agent for some reasons e.g. to be more tactful</li>
                  </ol>
                  </li>
                  <li>Another rule of thumb to bear in mind is conciseness and precision. In general, you should choose a structure that will allow you to express your idea more concisely i.e. If an idea can be expressed more concisely in passive, go for the passive voice, or vice-versa.</li>
                  <li>Bear in mind that that the use of active and passive voice is dependent on the context of your research / writing and also varies across disciplines. You may wish to check with tutors from your discipline first on the writing conventions pertinent to your field. Some disciplines may frown upon the excessive use of passive while in some, it is accepted. The use of active/passive voice is a complex and contentious issue. You may also follow the link below for a detailed discussion of the “active-passive debate” in the academia. <br>

                  </li>
                  <li>If you wish to be more tactful in your arguments, apart from using the passive to hide the agent, you should also use others rhetorical devices such as hedges. Go through the section on “Hedging, Boosting and Balancing the Argument” on this website.</li>
