                  <li>
                    <p>In addition to being used to refer to previously mentioned ideas and information, “it” is frequently used in two other ways:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>A. An “empty” reference or “dummy” subject.</strong></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>When used as an empty or dummy reference, “it” does not refer to a specific noun or noun phrase in the text, instead ‘it’ refers to the general situation in which, or about which, the statement is made. For example:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>1. It</strong> appears that Asian travellers and Western travellers had significantly different perceptions of various attributes of air quality in general, and particularly the air quality in Hong Kong. (Law & Cheung,
                    2007)</li>
                  <li><strong>2. </strong>When <strong>it</strong> came to interpreting findings, there are a lot of important factors that need to be carefully considered.</li>
                  <li>
                    <p>For the two examples above, “it” refers to nothing more than the situation rather than to any specific word or phrase in the sentence.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>

          <div class="col-lg-12 mb-5">
            <div class="item">

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>In addition to being used to refer to previously mentioned ideas and information, “it” is frequently used in two other ways:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p><strong>B. An “anticipatory” reference</strong></p>
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    <p>“It” is also used as an “anticipatory” reference to information that comes later in the sentence. For example:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>1. It</strong> has long been a prevalent belief among the Chinese that <u>effective government and education go hand-in-hand.</u></li>
                  <li><strong>2. It</strong> is striking that <u>all reference to the aim of encouraging, let alone "enforcing," a sense of local identity was omitted from official documents from the mid-1990s onward.</u></li>
                  <li>
                    <p>The function or purpose of using “it” as an anticipatory reference is to highlight or emphasize the idea being referred to. The sentences above could be re-written without an anticipatory “it,” but the prominence and clarity
                      of the main idea that “it” serves to highlight would be weakened.</p>
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-12 mb-5">
            <div class="item">

                <ul>
                  <li>
                    <p>Use of “it” as an anticipatory subject to highlight an idea later in the sentence is a common way to emphasize a statement in academic writing. It is also used in academic writing with the passive voice to create
                      “objective-sounding” statements:</p>
                  </li>
                  <li><strong>It</strong> is generally thought that the Hong Kong government's air pollution index does not accurately reflect the level of risk to respiratory health caused by air pollution in the city.</li>
