                    refer to previously mentioned ideas and information. These two pronouns are generally not
                    interchangeable when used to refer to previously mentioned things, and misusing them can cause
                    confusion for a reader. A key factor in deciding when to use “it” or “this” is the length or scope
                    of information to which the writer wants to refer. For example:</h5>

                      This view of the state's educative, paternalistic function is still widely adhered to by Hong
                      Kong people, even though it might seem to sit uneasily alongside the democratic aspirations that

                  <h5 class="list_title"><strong>B. "Which" </strong>is a relative pronoun used to construct relative clauses. Relative clauses are used to give additional information about a thing mentioned in a sentence. The grammar of relative clauses is a separate topic and will not be covered here, but one feature of the usage of “which” is relevant to our discussion in this unit. The examples below illustrate that “which” can be used to refer to a previously mentioned noun or noun phrase, or can be used to refer to a previous clause or sentence. For example:</h5>
                  <!--example1-->
                  <div class="row pl-4">
